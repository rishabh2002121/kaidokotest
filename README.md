Hello Kaidoko,
Well dont know how to start but i haven't slept from friday, coz i was doing this project whole night, but i enjoyed it.
well first i saw the design and took a paper and pen to design your layout so i can get the idea how to do the job.
i started by writing html, like making all those section and all, its was fine but in css there are many type of layout so i didnt use that much reusable code, making a new class for every 2nd element. Well i translated your given design into fully functional web page, your sample home page with exact design and fully responsive for all devices (i think so). With interesting featurse and UX. I used pure javascript in this project no other 3rd party library nor React, i implmented features like Sticky Navigation, Mobile Responsive Navbar, Tabbed Component, Revealing Section on Scrolls and others things too.
Well thanks for the assessment, now im off to sleep. :)
